mage Caption Generator
Overview
The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning project that takes an image as input and generates a meaningful caption describing the contents of the image. It is trained on the Flickr8k dataset and utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve accurate and contextually relevant image captions.

Features
Image Captioning: The core feature of the project is its ability to generate descriptive captions for input images.
Deep Learning: Utilizes a deep learning model (e.g., CNN-LSTM) to extract image features and generate captions.
Flickr8k Dataset: Trained on the widely used Flickr8k dataset, which contains a diverse range of images and corresponding captions.
Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.
User-Friendly: Provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for generating captions for images.
Technologies Used
Deep Learning: The project relies on deep learning techniques and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and inference.
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the project.
Flickr8k Dataset: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing and handling.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLP techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant captions.
Getting Started
To run the Image Caption Generator project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/mdainainahmed/Image-Caption-Generator.git
Go through the code and download files from given links.

Usage
Provide an image as input to the Image Caption Generator.

The model will analyze the image and generate a descriptive caption.

The generated caption can be displayed alongside the image.

Users can experiment with different images to see how well the model generates captions.
